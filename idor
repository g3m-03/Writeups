🗑️ IDOR in Blog Deletion

📌 Introduction

    - While testing a program on Bugcrowd, I noticed that it had just transitioned from private to public.
    - I decided to target it immediately — fresh public programs often still have leftovers from initial development.
    - One of my favorite vulnerabilities to test early is IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):
        - Easy to test.
        - Often high-impact.

🧪 Testing Setup

    - Created two separate user accounts to test authorization logic.
    - Observed that the platform used simple incremental numeric IDs for:
          - Account IDs.
          - Blog post IDs.
    - Proceeded to test every major function for IDOR vulnerabilities.


🔍 Initial Attempts

    - Tested profile access → ❌ no IDOR.
    - Tested account updates → ❌ no IDOR.
    - Tested comment creation/deletion → ❌ no IDOR.
    - Tested other user-related features → ❌ no IDOR.
    - No luck… until I reached the Blog functionality.

📝 Blog Feature Analysis

    Each user could:
    - Create a blog post
    - Delete their own blog post
    - I created blog posts on both accounts.

🚫 First Day: Failed Attempt

    - I attempted to delete Account B’s blog post using Account A.
    - Result: 403 Forbidden
    - Not exploitable — yet.
    - But I read something interesting:Newly created blog posts remain private for 24 hours. After 24 hours, they become public by default.

      That gave me an idea.


 ⏳ Next Day Testing

    - Waited 24 hours for both blog posts to auto-publish.
    - Repeated the delete attempt:
    - Account A attempts to delete Account B’s blog post.
    
This time…

🎯 It worked.

    - The server allowed the deletion.
    - No ownership check after blogs became public.
    - Classic IDOR due to missing authorization after state change.


📨 Reporting

    -Immediately submitted the report on Bugcrowd.
    - Went to sleep happy thinking this might be a valid high/medium-impact issue.
    
Next morning…

❌ It was marked as Duplicate.
Someone had already found and reported it in January 2025.I reported it in March 2025.This became my first-ever duplicate in my bug bounty journey.


🥲 Final Thoughts

  - Even though it was a duplicate, I still consider this a win:
  - My methodology was solid.
  - I understood state-based authorization bugs.
  - The vulnerability was real and high-impact.
  - And it reinforced an important lesson:
  - Always test features again after state changes. Behavior can differ once objects become public, archived, expired, or moved.
